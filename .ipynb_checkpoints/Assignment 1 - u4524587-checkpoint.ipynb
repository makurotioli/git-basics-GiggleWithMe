    "- Very keen to learn modelling dynamical models\n",
    "- I have zero interest in the sophisticated math, I don't feel like I need to know the formal definition of stable to undertand the actual meaning of stable\n",
    "- This might be my only chance to learn comptemporary CGE modelling. I don't know if I will ever use them, but I want to know how to construct them.\n",
    "- I am very concious of the time commitments of the class. It is difficult balancing full time work and study.\n",
    "- I am extremely concious of the in-person requirements of this course. I now work on the other side of Civic, so having to take 90 minutes of additional travel time twice a week is painful.\n",
    "- Keen to learn, not keen to score well in grades. I'm learning for interest. I have a good economics job, and no interest in further study, so the payoff for high marks is exactly zero.\n",
    "- I wont lie, I am more excited by this course than just about any other I have done lately. Thank you very much."
